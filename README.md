# milligrad

Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), **milligrad** introduces numpy for matrix operations, adding one more layer of abstraction to the exploration of automatic differentiation.

This project was developed as part of the assignments for the DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science course at KTH.
